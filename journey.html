                <p class="journey-text text-left">
                    It all started when I was part of a job seekers agency, where I took some tests in a field (coding) I knew nothing about. Needless to say, I passed all 3 tests and I was further chosen to be a part of a group of 80 women to attend a Gamesday bootcamp at ADA. The invitation was a little vague and without knowing what to expect, it was hard to prepare for the day. On my arrival, we introduced ourselves and the games began. We built board games on paper, using minimal supplies and former knowledge of indigineous games I played as a child.
                </p>
                <p class="journey-text text-left">
                    Fast forward to a month (July) later, I was chosen again to be part of the 30 women who would possibly be the final group of students for the  coding program that would run for a year. The bootcamp ran for three days where we were closely observed and at the beginning, the software used was user friendly and somewhat seemed easy as a knowledge of geometry was applied. We were split into teams of 4 where we worked on projects together and individually. Interacting with women from different backgrounds gives one perspective and insight into our different paths and broadens one's knowledge on how to deal with diversity. As we began to learn how to code, I was inspired by how we were all eager to learn this new skill, to better ourselves. There were points where some tasks were difficult but with constant practise, research and learning, it became easier to move on to the next task. That built confidence in me to say that with any obstacle that came along, overcoming is possible.
                </p>
                <p class="journey-text text-left">
                    At the end of the month, I received an email stating that I was accepted into the year long program. In August, the program began and we were scheduled to learn 3 coding languages. HTML seemed rather easy as the skeleton of website design. CSS was another language we learned, which added styling and positioning the website.Javascript taught me about the functionality of the website. These 3 languages combined, make for creative and user friendly websites. Learning Javascript, at first, was rather challenging but with the help of the lectures and online studying through W3schools and Free code camp, learning it became easier.

                <p class="journey-text text-left">
                    Unfortunately, the worldwide pandemic Covid-19 has taken two months from the program and internships at companies that cater for front end developers. It was a tough pill to swallow but regardless, the skills have been learnt and what's left is for me to hustle on!

                <p class="journey-text text-left">
                    ADA, named after Ada Lovelace (the first female coder), is a non-profit programme which aims to educate young women of colour to become Front-End Developers and join the tech industry. ADA provides an immersive, mentored, fully-funded web development education to young, African, women.
                </p>
                <p class="journey-text text-left">
                    ADA's mission is to empower. They give young, African women the tools and confidence to become successful game-changers in the field of technology by providing them with immersive, mentored, fully-funded Front-End Development education.

                <p class="journey-text">
                    The African Developers Academy had limited capacity in its first ever year, and so had to be rigorous in their testing and eventual selection of the student body of 2019/2020. This meant that students had to apply first through Harambe, where they completed a series of aptitude tests to make sure that they had what it takes to be a web developer.
                </p>
                <p class="journey-text">
                    There were 500 applications, 100 selected candidates through Harambe and only 12 spots. This means that only 2% of applicants would make it through.
                </p>
                <p class="journey-text">
                    All of the 100 selected candidates were invited to take part in challenges hosted by ADA which put them to the test - checking for resilience, strength of character, attitude and of course ability. The women who made it through proved themselves in many ways, and continued to do so throughout their studies.
